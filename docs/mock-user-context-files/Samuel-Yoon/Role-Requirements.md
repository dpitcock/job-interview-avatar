# Samuel Yoon — Ideal Role & Work Environment Requirements

---

## 1. Work Location & Flexibility

- **Remote-first culture preferred**, with **quarterly or biannual on-site gatherings** for collaboration and connection.  
  I enjoy meeting people face-to-face occasionally — it strengthens teamwork — but I don’t believe productivity requires constant proximity.

- **Hybrid acceptable** (1–2 days/week in-office) if the culture truly supports asynchronous collaboration.  
  I can work anywhere but need autonomy to decide when presence actually matters.

- **Companies enforcing 5-day, meet-in-seat rules** concern me.  
  To me, this policy signals old thinking and a “tree-shaking” maneuver for controlling budgets. My instinct says those orgs will downsize soon. I prefer companies that trust employees, not timecards.

---

## 2. Collaboration & Culture

- **At least 1–2 meeting-free days per week.**  
  Focus time drives exceptional output, especially in front-end and system architecture work. Daily standups are fine — but context-switching every hour isn’t.

- **Asynchronous, high-transparency communication.**  
  Slack, Notion, or internal wikis used as living documents — not forgotten silos.

- **Storypoints and peer feedback during Agile planning.**  
  I like collaborative estimation where junior and senior engineers weigh in together. It makes everyone own velocity, not just measure it.

- **Constructive code reviews and shared learning.**  
  I look for teams with institutionalized knowledge-sharing — things like internal “tech brown bags,” engineering blogs, or playbooks for recurring problems.

---

## 3. Growth and Career Development

- I value **structured growth paths** that allow me to explore both technical leadership (**Principal Engineer**) and people leadership (**Engineering Manager**) routes.

- Ideally, an organization that offers:
  - Rotations or shadow programs across disciplines (product, design, infra).
  - Sponsored conference travel or speaking opportunities.
  - Access to mentorship and external training (technical or leadership-focused).

- Long-term, I’m interested in transitioning toward **product engineering or DX platform leadership** — bridging engineering decisions with product outcomes.

---

## 4. Technology & Engineering Values

- **Modern, maintainable tech stack.**  
  TypeScript, React/Next.js, and a DevOps-friendly culture with CI/CD maturity. I don’t mind legacy code — I mind lack of ownership.

- **AI and automation embraced thoughtfully.**  
  I want a company experimenting with AI-assisted workflows (e.g., AI testing or documentation), not dismissing it as a fad.

- **Engineering craftsmanship over velocity theatrics.**  
  I prefer environments that reward clean, sustainable progress instead of “hero coding” and burnout-driven sprints.

- **Autonomy with accountability.**  
  Let engineers own the how, and judge them on outcomes, not busyness.

---

## 5. Diversity, Inclusion, and Learning

- **Genuinely diverse teams** — across identity, geography, and perspective.  
  I learn best in rooms where people don’t all think like me. That diversity sharpens product intuition.

- A workplace that **values mentorship in both directions.**  
  I want to mentor juniors and learn from senior architects, PMs, or even designers.

- **Openness to unconventional backgrounds.**  
  Some of the best engineers I’ve worked with came from art, biology, or music. A culture that celebrates multidisciplinary curiosity is one that builds better products.

---

## 6. Work Style and Hours

- **Flexible hours** — I often schedule midday blocks for workouts or appointments, then log back in later.  
  Output matters more than presence.

- **Clear deliverables and trust-based progress tracking.**  
  When metrics measure outcomes, not attendance, I consistently over-deliver.

- **Strong respect for personal life boundaries.**  
  Late-night deploys are fine when necessary — but they should be the exception, not the systemic expectation.

---

## 7. Compensation and Benefits

- Competitive base salary and total compensation aligned with senior-level market rates.  
  I’m not chasing money — I’m chasing fair investment in long-term retention.

- Annual education or skills budget: ideally $2,000+ for conferences, courses, or side learning.  
- Health coverage that supports global mobility or remote setups.  
- If US/EU hybrid, equitable handling of tax and remote allowances.

---

## 8. Team and Leadership Qualities I Value

- Transparent, empathetic management with a bias for clarity.  
- Leaders who communicate the "why," not just hand off the "what."  
- Teams where laughter and curiosity aren’t rare on Slack.  
- People who care more about fixing problems than assigning blame.  
- A culture where success is shared and failures are learned from honestly.

---

## 9. Non-Negotiables

- Rigid attendance mandates or micro-managed productivity systems.  
- Lack of async tools or shared documentation.  
- Toxic hero culture masked as “startup hustle.”  
- No defined growth path beyond senior IC roles.  
- Leadership teams allergic to experimentation or feedback.

---

## 10. Ideal Summary

**I’m looking for a company that:**
- Trusts its engineers.  
- Values results over appearances.  
- Teaches as much as it challenges.  
- Invests in developer experience the way it invests in product experience.  
- Encourages me to grow — not just in skill, but in perspective.

If a company shares those values, I’ll bring everything I’ve learned from AWS, Audible, and Meta — and invest it right back.
