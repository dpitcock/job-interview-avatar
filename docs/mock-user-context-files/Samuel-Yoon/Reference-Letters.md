# Reference Letters for Samuel Yoon

---

## 1. Priya Desai — Senior Engineering Manager, Amazon Web Services (AWS)

**To Whom It May Concern,**

I’m writing to strongly recommend **Samuel Yoon**, who reported directly to me for over four years on the Cloudscape team at Amazon Web Services. During that time, Samuel consistently demonstrated technical depth, thoughtful leadership, and a rare ability to bridge engineering excellence with developer empathy.

When Samuel joined, Cloudscape’s build pipeline was slow and unstable, frustrating hundreds of internal users. He led the initiative to modernize the entire monorepo, migrating build tooling to Vite and implementing CI/CD caching strategies. The result was remarkable — build times dropped by more than 60%, and developer satisfaction scores improved within a single quarter.

Samuel also created **DocBot**, an internal AI-powered documentation assistant later open-sourced within AWS. That project alone saved our team hundreds of engineering hours per year and improved contributor engagement across more than twenty service teams. His work earned him an **AWS Engineering Excellence Award** — a recognition that only a handful of individual contributors receive globally each year.

What I appreciate most about Samuel is his leadership style. He leads through inclusion and technical credibility, not authority. He mentors junior developers patiently, collaborates openly with design and product teams, and consistently raises the bar for communication clarity in pull requests.

If you’re seeking a senior engineer who thrives in ambiguous environments, executes at scale, and deeply values developer experience, I can’t recommend Samuel more highly. He’s one of the most thoughtful engineers I’ve had the privilege to manage.

**Sincerely,**

## 2. Marta Alvarez — Director of Front-End Engineering, Audible (Amazon)

**To Whom It May Concern,**

I had the pleasure of managing **Samuel Yoon** during his tenure at Audible from 2018 through 2020, where he served as a Frontend Engineer II on our Consumer Web and Mobile teams.

Samuel played a critical role in the modernization of Audible’s web architecture, leading our migration from legacy Backbone and jQuery codebases to TypeScript and React. His work was instrumental in reducing production defects by 35% and dramatically improving site performance — lowering the homepage load time from over six seconds to under three. Beyond these metrics, Samuel was truly a cultural anchor on the team.

He approaches engineering with curiosity and accountability. When backend and frontend teams disagreed about API structure, Samuel built performance prototypes to drive decisions with data, not opinion. That maturity helped us establish a new pattern for cross-functional collaboration at Audible.

Samuel also mentored several engineers, most notably **Nora Feldman**, who went on to become one of our best performers after his guidance. Even when working under pressure — like late-night production incidents or tight product deadlines — he maintained composure, humor, and teamwork.

I recommend Samuel wholeheartedly. He is a world-class engineer with a creative problem-solving instinct, a deep understanding of web technology, and a personality that earns trust from everyone he works with.

**Sincerely,**

## 3. Lena Tran — Senior DevOps Engineer, Amazon Web Services

**To Whom It May Concern,**

I’m pleased to offer this reference for **Samuel Yoon**, with whom I worked closely for more than three years on the AWS Cloudscape team. As the lead DevOps engineer responsible for our CI/CD pipelines, I partnered with Samuel on numerous cross-functional initiatives — from monorepo rebuilds to visual regression stabilization.

What impressed me most was Samuel’s ability to translate between disciplines. Many frontend developers have limited patience for infrastructure, but Samuel treated DevOps as a shared space. He not only learned our Jenkins and GitHub Actions systems in depth but often proposed optimizations that increased throughput and reduced CI time by 45%.

We co-led the redesign of Cloudscape’s visual regression testing platform using Playwright. This project reduced false positives by over 90% and became the model pipeline for several other open-source AWS projects. Samuel’s leadership in that effort — particularly in documenting and presenting the solution internally — was a masterclass in cross-team collaboration.

Samuel doesn’t just deliver; he uplifts the environment around him. His meetings are calm, well-organized, and full of subtle humor. Colleagues trust him implicitly.

I have no doubt he’ll excel wherever he goes next. Samuel is both a top-tier engineer and one of the most collaborative professionals I’ve ever partnered with.

**Warm regards,**
