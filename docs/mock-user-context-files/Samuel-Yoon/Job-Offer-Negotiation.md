# Job Offer & Negotiation Responses — Samuel Yoon

---

## 1. Start Date Preferences

- **Earliest Start Date:** ~2 months from offer acceptance.  
  This timing accounts for smooth transition, project handover, and personal planning.

- **If relocation is required:** Start date becomes **3 months** to allow proper logistics, housing, and documentation, unless a **hybrid ramp-up** option (remote onboarding pre-move) is available.

- **Flexibility:** Open to discussion if onboarding can begin remotely while relocation completes. Has done successful remote pre-onboarding previously at AWS and Audible.

---

## 2. Vacation and Time Off Philosophy

- Historically receives **20–25 days of annual paid vacation** and values that baseline.  
  Time off is essential for long-term excellence, creativity, and technical sharpness.

- Prefers companies that treat PTO as **human recovery, not earned debt**.  
  “Good engineers need to recharge to stay sharp — shipping code is a marathon, not a sprint.”

- Curious about **extended sabbatical programs** after long-term tenure (e.g., 5+ years).  
  Believes these programs foster retention and attract serious career-minded engineers.

## 3. Compensation Philosophy

Samuel prefers to delay numerical discussion until late-stage alignment, focusing first on **mutual value fit**.

- Anything under 200k is not even worth considering. Realistically looking in the 330k range.

- Kows the market rate for senior engineers in the area. Uses peer/network converstion and https://levels.fyi/ to get a sense of the market. 

- Openly states:  
  **“I usually position around the 75–80th percentile of the salary band for senior engineers, with the goal of proving I belong at the top once performance is visible.”**

- Focuses on **total compensation** and career progression opportunities rather than headline salary alone.  
  Equity, professional development, and flexibility weigh strongly.

- Expects **transparency on leveling frameworks** so expectations are clear on growth path and evaluation criteria.

- Example response if pressed for numbers:  
  *“I’d prefer to first understand the role level, internal bands, and performance metrics — that way we can align on total value rather than guessing figures out of context.”*

---

## 4. Relocation Preferences

- **Primary relocation interest:** **New York City** (preferred and ideal).  
  Familiar with the city, community, and climate; sees NYC as a good cultural and creative center.

- **Hesitant to relocate elsewhere.**  
  Would need strong justification, e.g., unique role scope, exceptional team culture, or flexible hybrid policy.

- **Open to remote-first roles** with quarterly in-person meetups, even if the company HQ is elsewhere.

- Example phrasing:  
  *“I’m primarily focused on NYC roles right now, but I’m open to considering other options if remote flexibility or hybrid rhythm makes sense long-term.”*

## 5. Benefits and Perks Preferences

Samuel believes strong productivity comes from healthy work–life integration. His preferred benefits include:

- **Gym or fitness allowance.**  
  Regular training and kite surfing are core parts of his balance routine.

- **Commuter benefits or urban travel stipend.**  
  Useful even for hybrid roles to offset partial in-office time.

- **Meal or food stipend** (monthly or daily).  
  Encourages healthier day-to-day work energy during intense projects.

- **Conference participation:** Two per year ideal.
  - **One internal or company conference** for team connection.  
  - **One external industry conference or event** for ongoing learning and networking.  
  (e.g., React Summit, AWS re:Invent, or PyCon).

- **Education and skills reimbursement** for technical or AI-related courses.

- **Strong health coverage and flexible sick leave policy.**

---

## 6. Work Schedule & Culture Fit

- Prefers **flexible core hours** (e.g., teams aligned on overlap from 10am–3pm local time).  
  Uses early or late hours for deep work or personal commitments.

- Appreciates **no-meeting days** once or twice per week for focus and built-in mental recharge.

- Wants to work at a company that values:
  - Output and ownership over attendance.  
  - Continuous learning and psychological safety.  
  - Healthy innovation culture — experiment first, blame never.

---

## 7. Long-Term Growth Outlook

- Interested in pursuing either the **Principal Engineer** route or **Engineering Management/Developer Experience leadership** path, depending on team structure.  
  Chooses environments where both tracks are clearly supported and rewarded.

- Looks for companies with **career narratives and feedback cadence** aligned to growth, not static titles.

- Example phrasing:  
  *“I want to grow into a leadership role that balances technical depth with team empowerment — maybe one day running a developer experience group or product engineering division.”*

---

## 8. General Negotiation Tone & Principles

- Professional, collaborative, never adversarial.  
  Samuel negotiates with calm data, not ego.

- He values **equity in trust** over a few percentage points — meaning he’ll trade slightly lower numbers for long-term alignment, respectful leadership, and structured autonomy.

- If asked about competing offers:  
  *“I’m considering what environment will best support how I build and lead — culture alignment will guide my choice more than compensation deltas.”*

- If asked for flexibility:  
  *“I value flexible arrangements — I can be pragmatic as long as there’s clarity, fairness, and mutual respect.”*
